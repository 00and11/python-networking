# Python Networking

Welcome to the **Python Networking** repository! This repository contains sample programs demonstrating various networking concepts using the Python language. Whether you're a beginner or looking to enhance your understanding of network programming, you'll find practical examples and useful code snippets here.

## Contents

### 1. **TCP Server and Client**
   - **Description**: Examples of TCP server and client applications. These programs demonstrate how to establish a reliable connection-oriented communication channel using the TCP protocol.
   - **Usage**: Instructions on how to set up and run the TCP server and client.

### 2. **UDP Server and Client**
   - **Description**: Sample code for UDP server and client communication. Unlike TCP, UDP is a connectionless protocol, and these examples highlight its use cases.
